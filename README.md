We have been contracted to build an application that will make our customer millions of dollars! They want to have a way to display information about popular TV actors, TV show genres, and the TV shows themselves. We are dealing with three sets of data: Actors, TV Shows, and Genres. Make an ERD for the data.

### Actors

A TV watcher wants to see a list of actors. When the actor name is clicked on, the show(s) in which the actor is the star should be displayed in an alert message.

### Genres

A TV watcher wants to see a list of genres. When a genre is clicked on, all the shows of that genre should be displayed in an alert message.

### Shows

A TV watcher wants to see a list of shows. The show name, star actor, and genre should all be displayed.

# Layout

At the top of the browser window, the actor list should be displayed on the left, and the genre list should be displayed on the right.

Beneath the actor and genre lists, the list of shows should be displayed.

Make a wireframe for the application.
